# Cpp_Programming_Data_Structures_1

This respiratory contains the homeworks and the solutions of the CS 201 (Fundamental Structures of Computer Science 1) course I took at Bilkent University. This course introduces the abstract data types of lists, stacks and queues, and shows how one can implement them in C++ using fundamental data structures. It also introduces recursion and algorithm analysis.

* Homework 1: Implementing a banking system by using dynamic arrays and pointers.
* Homework 2: Algorithm analysis and comparing time complexity of different algorithms.
* Homework 3: Implementing a registration system by using linked lists. 
* Homework 4: Implementing a program for manipulating algebraic expressions of infix and postfix forms, converting an expression of infix form to postfix and evaluating the expressions.
